#  Heart and Kidney Disease Prediction System using machine learning
>The aim of this project is to predict heart and Kidney disease using data mining techniques and machine learning algorithms.This project implements 6 classificiation models using scikit-learn: Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, Support Vector Classifier,KNN, Nerual Network and Decision Tree Model to investigate their performance on heart and kidney disease datasets obtained from the UCI data repository and from Kaggle.com.
